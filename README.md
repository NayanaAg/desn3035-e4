Exercise 4 -- converting HTML into React website

I really enjoyed this lab because it helped some of the questions I've had ever since I started working on Assignment 1. I have a portfolio website I'm planning with a few complicated components, and I'm really happy to see all the features which let us modularize design because they'll make it much easier for me to develop my website with the original vision I had. I can definitely see the challenge in getting lost in error messages with unfamiliar syntax, but I think if we're methodical and tackle them one step at a time it will be much easier. Really fun lab overall!
